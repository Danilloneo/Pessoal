Fundamentals of IT Hardware and Software, Database Administration, Information Technology Security, Introduction to Computer Networks, Office Package, Balance Sheet Analysis by Fundação Bradesco. SQL from Basic to Advanced and Linux by Udemy. Full Stack Programming by Danki Code with an emphasis on Web Designer. Ethical hacker by Danki Code. Basic English by IESTUDAR. Cell Phone Maintenance by the Institute of Professional Courses. Security Cameras by Hotmart. And I constantly update myself on many other topics. In addition, since I was little, I have been formatting and maintaining computers, and I was a systems analyst for one of the largest software resellers in Brazil, Linx, and today I work as a Lead Support Analyst at Quality WebPostos for the Litoral Postos reseller in the fuels station segment. I'm also studying Python at Ebac.
